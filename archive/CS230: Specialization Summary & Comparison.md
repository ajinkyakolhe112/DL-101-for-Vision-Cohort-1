CS230
1. Comparison with other courses
   1. Kaggle Learn
   2. Udemy Practical Pytorch
   3. ERA1
   4. Udacity Pytorch
   5. sentdex NN from Scratch
2. Why:
   1. Reputed, On field experience Instructor
      1. Many Good courses on internet, but how many are actual Data Scientists?
   2. High Quality: (Stanford University)
   3. Past Student Projects for Comparison
   4. Open & Free: Unlike other expensive paid courses
3. But
   1. Difficult for beginners
      1. Numpy first, Tensorflow later
      2. Expects 
      3. Videos technically heavy 
      4. Not very interesting instructor, (spectrum of interesting but not knowledge vs others)
      5. less analogies & interesting examples to help understand better
      6. Less hands on tools for learning
   2. Misc
      1. Accent & Handwriting difficult to follow
      2. Not cutting edge slides or tools
         1. NN from Scratch in Python sentdex
         2. 3MathBrown
4. Improvements?
   1. Keras + Tensorflow Playground
   2. Keras -> Tensorflow -> Numpy Implementation. (Increamental Complexity)
   3. Spiral Learning of Same fundamental Building Block
5. Goal: 5 Courses
