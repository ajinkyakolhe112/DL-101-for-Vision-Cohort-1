## Mastering Deep Learning in Career Break

My Process of mastering Deep Learning in 2023
Career Break for Personal & Professional Development.
---
## Agenda
#### Goal
1. Learning Goal: "Mastering Deep Learning in Career Break"
2. Learning Scope: "(Graduate Level) Knowledge in AI from (Stanford)" + "CS230 Course Projects" + "Fast AI Projects"

#### Problems - Extreme Hype & Large Influencers 
3. "Deep Learning" & Truth it's the Hype
4. Masters vs Influencers
    - Deep Learning is Harder. Neural Networks coding is Easy
    - Mastery is Hard
    - Normal Genius vs Peerless Genius. Masters like Richard Feynman or Leonardo Da Vinci

#### Learning Resources
4. Learning Resources & their distribution
    - Too many resources
    - Expensive Course != Good Course, Long Course != Good Course
7. "Learning Resources Hell" vs "Learning Process"

#### Nature of Deep Learning & Consequences
1. Code is simple & small (100 lines). 
3. Consequence. Understanding lags behind coding. Illusion of understanding. 
4. Breakthroughs are easy to understand, but hard to do. e = mc^2 difficulty. or 3 newton's law. (Physics)
5. Nascent field. Need original thinkers because there haven't been people who have even thought this. 
    - Imagine you want to send rocket to moon, but neither newton's law, nor calculus are invented.
6. Intelligence of Brain 1% known, ANI 1% known. Mature field like physics vs this field.
2. Understanding Deep Learning is very Hard.
