My Process of mastering Deep Learning in 2023
Career Break for Personal & Professional Development.



## Agenda
1. 2023 - Year of Mastering Deep Learning
3. Expensive Course != Good Course, Long Course != Good Course

## Designing "custom" Learning Plan
- 2 Phase Learning Plan
    - Phase 1, more introduction and foundations & concepts. 
    - Phase 2 can go into more depth & reinforce fundamentals

## So for Phase 1
1. Courses should be beginner friendly
2. Easy in beginning with incremental complexity vs Steep learning curve
3. One thing at a time
4. Choose courses with different POVs
