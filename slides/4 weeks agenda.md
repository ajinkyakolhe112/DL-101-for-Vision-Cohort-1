2. Class Problem: Image classification on Bit more Complex Data (cifar10)
3. Assignment Problem: Image classification accuracy on Complex Data (imagenet-100 & 1k). Just attempting
4. Assignment Problem: Push accuracy of CIFAR10 / Innovate on. with parametric experiments

### Agenda - Week 3
1. In Class attempting: imagenet 100 & 1k & attempting innovate
    3. Experiment via training_script. arg parser
    4. One batch & time to overfit num_classes batch
2. Building testing functions for essential functions. mastery of shape & kernel sizes,out_size calculation. neurons
3. Class Problem: Image Classification on 1k
4. Existing architectures, CNNs & their principals

### Agenda - Week 4 
1. Transfer Learning
3. Learning Rate Policies, Activation Functions etc. Hyper-parameter optimization (cifar10 & imgnet 100)
2. Experiment via yaml config
3. Comming Next: LLM or Classification -> Segmentation -> Others

- [ ] DL from scratch in pytorch, like keras api. write as a package in python
- [ ] Pytorch Snippets extension: rewritten for custom code snippets
- [ ] Model Parameter Analysis
- [ ] Testing functions. Model Forward Pass, DataSet Shape
- [ ] Pytorch Glossary & Documentation: Essential
- [ ] Anki Flash Cards
- [ ] Quizz testing understanding (those who know code & lingo but not understanding)
- [ ] Assignment forcing to rethink from completely different point of view. So copy paste doesn't work
- [ ] WandB Learning Curves
- [ ] WandB Misclassified & Correctly classified
- [ ] Teaching Aids
    - Tensorflow Playground, nn_svg
