## Agenda

### Agenda - Week 1 (Training Wheel)
1. Learn "Simplified Neural Network", end to end
2. Class Problem: Image classification on Simple Data (mnist)
3. Assignment Problem: Image classification on bit more Complex Data (cifar10)
4. Class Ranking: Kaggle Leaderboard & Huggingface Leaderboard

Real Scale: Number of Parameters to solve a complex problem in vision. or Number of Parameters to solve a complex problem in NLP
### Agenda - Week 2 (Training Wheel)
1. Learn "Neural Network", end to end. parametric experiments & experiment tracking
2. Class Problem: Image classification on Bit more Complex Data (cifar10)
3. Assignment Problem: Image classification accuracy on Complex Data (imagenet-100 & 1k). Just attempting
4. Assignment Problem: Push accuracy of CIFAR10 / Innovate on. with parametric experiments

### Mini Project: Kaggle Competition: MNIST & CIFAR10. Together
### Contribute:(TIMER MISSION) Keras Core Library

### Agenda - Week 3
1. In Class attempting: imagenet 100 & 1k & attempting innovate
    3. Experiment via training_script. arg parser
    4. One batch & time to overfit num_classes batch
2. Building testing functions for essential functions. mastery of shape & kernel sizes,out_size calculation. neurons
3. Class Problem: Image Classification on 1k
4. Existing architectures, CNNs & their principals

### Agenda - Week 4 
1. Transfer Learning as readymade models.
3. Learning Rate Policies, Activation Functions etc. Hyper-parameter optimization (cifar10 & imgnet 100)
2. Experiment via yaml config
3. Higher Level Libraries: Fast ai. (only after pytorch, because we don't understand). So that everything we have learned is done automatically in backend.
4. Comming Next: LLM or Classification -> Segmentation -> Others

Extra Implement
- [ ] Cookbook of STANDARDIZED: Simple End to End Code
- [ ] **DL from scratch in pytorch, like keras api. write as a package in python**. Just COPY as is. for use in first week 1 & 2. 
- [ ] Pytorch Snippets extension: rewritten for custom code snippets
- [ ] Model Parameter Analysis
- [ ] Testing functions. Model Forward Pass, DataSet Shape
- [ ] Pytorch Glossary & Documentation: Essential
- [ ] Anki Flash Cards
- [ ] Quizz testing understanding (those who know code & lingo but not understanding)
- [ ] Assignment forcing to rethink from completely different point of view. So copy paste doesn't work
- [ ] WandB Learning Curves
- [ ] WandB Misclassified & Correctly classified
- [ ] Teaching Aids
    - Tensorflow Playground, nn_svg
    - Convolution (Single, Multichannel, Youtube)
    - NN from scratch
    - What are NN really


Week 1 & 2: Training Wheels. Learn Neural Networks. Data is small: 30 pixels by 30 pixels. 
- Conv2d, Linear, ReLU, 
Week 2

### 5. Simple - building block, Complex - large number of interconnected blocks & NOT Complicated - 
Complex and complicated are two words that are often used interchangeably, but they have slightly different meanings.
complex systems are more difficult to understand and manage than complicated systems.
Complicated Relationship. but if we were to term it precisely, its two processes stuck in a deadlock, both draining mental energy, time.

Coding + Training + Kaggle + Maths + High Dimentional Nature of intermediate step, and how its not understandable by human. it makes it complicated
Simple Building Blocks need to mastered thoroughly. So that we can write them in our sleep. So we will practice them multiple times.
